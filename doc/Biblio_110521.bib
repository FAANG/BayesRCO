Deriving accurate predictions of complex traits requires implementing whole-genome regression (WGR) models where phenotypes are regressed on thousands of markers concurrently. Methods exist that allow implementing these large-p with small-n regressions, and genome-enabled selection (GS) is being implemented in several plant and animal breeding programs. The list of available methods is long, and the relationships between them have not been fully addressed. In this article we provide an overview of available methods for implementing parametric WGR models, discuss selected topics that emerge in applications, and present a general discussion of lessons learned from simulation and empirical data analysis in the last decade.},

Here we use a Bayesian mixture model that simultaneously allows variant discovery, estimation of genetic variance explained by all variants and prediction of unobserved phenotypes in new samples. We apply the method to simulated data of quantitative traits and Welcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) data on disease and show that it provides accurate estimates of SNP-based heritability, produces unbiased estimators of risk in new samples, and that it can estimate genetic architecture by partitioning variation across hundreds to thousands of SNPs. We estimated that, depending on the trait, 2,633 to 9,411 SNPs explain all of the SNP-based heritability in the WTCCC diseases. The majority of those SNPs ({\textgreater}96\%) had small effects, confirming a substantial polygenic component to common diseases. The proportion of the SNP-based variance explained by large effects (each SNP explaining 1\% of the variance) varied markedly between diseases, ranging from almost zero for bipolar disorder to 72\% for type 1 diabetes. Prediction analyses demonstrate that for diseases with major loci, such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, Bayesian methods outperform profile scoring or mixed model approaches.},

	abstract = {Many genome variants shaping mammalian phenotype are hypothesized to regulate gene transcription and/or to be under selection. However, most of the evidence to support this hypothesis comes from human studies. Systematic evidence for regulatory and evolutionary signals contributing to complex traits in a different mammalian model is needed. Sequence variants associated with gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci [eQTLs]) and concentration of metabolites (metabolic quantitative trait loci [mQTLs]) and under histone-modification marks in several tissues were discovered from multiomics data of over 400 cattle. Variants under selection and evolutionary constraint were identified using genome databases of multiple species. These analyses defined 30 sets of variants, and for each set, we estimated the genetic variance the set explained across 34 complex traits in 11,923 bulls and 32,347 cows with 17,669,372 imputed variants. The per-variant trait heritability of these sets across traits was highly consistent (
              r
              {\textgreater} 0.94) between bulls and cows. Based on the per-variant heritability, conserved sites across 100 vertebrate species and mQTLs ranked the highest, followed by eQTLs, young variants, those under histone-modification marks, and selection signatures. From these results, we defined a Functional-And-Evolutionary Trait Heritability (FAETH) score indicating the functionality and predicted heritability of each variant. In additional 7,551 cattle, the high FAETH-ranking variants had significantly increased genetic variances and genomic prediction accuracies in 3 production traits compared to the low FAETH-ranking variants. The FAETH framework combines the information of gene regulation, evolution, and trait heritability to rank variants, and the publicly available FAETH data provide a set of biological priors for cattle genomic selection worldwide.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12711-014-0082-4},
	abstract = {Background: Genomic prediction of breeding values from dense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) genotypes is used for livestock and crop breeding, and can also be used to predict disease risk in humans. For some traits, the most accurate genomic predictions are achieved with non-linear estimates of SNP effects from Bayesian methods that treat SNP effects as random effects from a heavy tailed prior distribution. These Bayesian methods are usually implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) schemes to sample from the posterior distribution of SNP effects, which is computationally expensive. Our aim was to develop an efficient expectation–maximisation algorithm (emBayesR) that gives similar estimates of SNP effects and accuracies of genomic prediction than the MCMC implementation of BayesR (a Bayesian method for genomic prediction), but with greatly reduced computation time.
Methods: emBayesR is an approximate EM algorithm that retains the BayesR model assumption with SNP effects sampled from a mixture of normal distributions with increasing variance. emBayesR differs from other proposed non-MCMC implementations of Bayesian methods for genomic prediction in that it estimates the effect of each SNP while allowing for the error associated with estimation of all other SNP effects. emBayesR was compared to BayesR using simulated data, and real dairy cattle data with 632 003 SNPs genotyped, to determine if the MCMC and the expectation-maximisation approaches give similar accuracies of genomic prediction.
Results: We were able to demonstrate that allowing for the error associated with estimation of other SNP effects when estimating the effect of each SNP in emBayesR improved the accuracy of genomic prediction over emBayesR without including this error correction, with both simulated and real data. When averaged over nine dairy traits, the accuracy of genomic prediction with emBayesR was only 0.5\% lower than that from BayesR. However, emBayesR reduced computing time up to 8-fold compared to BayesR.
Conclusions: The emBayesR algorithm described here achieved similar accuracies of genomic prediction to BayesR for a range of simulated and real 630 K dairy SNP data. emBayesR needs less computing time than BayesR, which will allow it to be applied to larger datasets.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12711-014-0074-4},
	abstract = {Background: Genomic selection is increasingly widely practised, particularly in dairy cattle. However, the accuracy of current predictions using GBLUP (genomic best linear unbiased prediction) decays rapidly across generations, and also as selection candidates become less related to the reference population. This is likely caused by the effects of causative mutations being dispersed across many SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) that span large genomic intervals. In this paper, we hypothesise that the use of a nonlinear method (BayesR), combined with a multi-breed (Holstein/Jersey) reference population will map causative mutations with more precision than GBLUP and this, in turn, will increase the accuracy of genomic predictions for selection candidates that are less related to the reference animals.
Results: BayesR improved the across-breed prediction accuracy for Australian Red dairy cattle for five milk yield and composition traits by an average of 7\% over the GBLUP approach (Australian Red animals were not included in the reference population). Using the multi-breed reference population with BayesR improved accuracy of prediction in Australian Red cattle by 2 – 5\% compared to using BayesR with a single breed reference population. Inclusion of 8478 Holstein and 3917 Jersey cows in the reference population improved accuracy of predictions for these breeds by 4 and 5\%. However, predictions for Holstein and Jersey cattle were similar using within-breed and multi-breed reference populations. We propose that the improvement in across-breed prediction achieved by BayesR with the multi-breed reference population is due to more precise mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL), which was demonstrated for several regions. New candidate genes with functional links to milk synthesis were identified using differential gene expression in the mammary gland.
Conclusions: QTL detection and genomic prediction are usually considered independently but persistence of genomic prediction accuracies across breeds requires accurate estimation of QTL effects. We show that accuracy of across-breed genomic predictions was higher with BayesR than with GBLUP and that BayesR mapped QTL more precisely. Further improvements of across-breed accuracy of genomic predictions and QTL mapping could be achieved by increasing the size of the reference population, including more breeds, and possibly by exploiting pleiotropic effects to improve mapping efficiency for QTL with small effects.},

	abstract = {Background: The accuracy of genomic prediction is highly dependent on the size of the reference population. For small populations, including information from other populations could improve this accuracy. The usual strategy is to pool data from different populations; however, this has not proven as successful as hoped for with distantly related breeds. BayesRS is a novel approach to share information across populations for genomic predictions. The approach allows information to be captured even where the phase of SNP alleles and casuative mutation alleles are reversed across populations, or the actual casuative mutation is different between the populations but affects the same gene. Proportions of a four-distribution mixture for SNP effects in segments of fixed size along the genome are derived from one population and set as location specific prior proportions of distributions of SNP effects for the target population. The model was tested using dairy cattle populations of different breeds: 540 Australian Jersey bulls, 2297 Australian Holstein bulls and 5214 Nordic Holstein bulls. The traits studied were protein-, fat- and milk yield. Genotypic data was Illumina 777K SNPs, real or imputed.
Results: Results showed an increase in accuracy of up to 3.5\% for the Jersey population when using BayesRS with a prior derived from Australian Holstein compared to a model without location specific priors. The increase in accuracy was however lower than was achieved when reference populations were combined to estimate SNP effects, except in the case of fat yield. The small size of the Jersey validation set meant that these improvements in accuracy were not significant using a Hotelling-Williams t-test at the 5\% level. An increase in accuracy of 1-2\% for all traits was observed in the Australian Holstein population when using a prior derived from the Nordic Holstein population compared to using no prior information. These improvements were significant (P{\textless}0.05) using the Hotelling Williams t-test for protein- and fat yield.
Conclusion: For some traits the method might be advantageous compared to pooling of reference data for distantly related populations, but further investigation is needed to confirm the results. For closely related populations the method does not perform better than pooling reference data. However, it does give an increased accuracy compared to analysis based on only one reference population, without an increased computational burden. The approach described here provides a general setup for inclusion of location specific priors: the approach could be used to include biological information in genomic predictions.},

In this study, we performed genomic prediction in Chinese Simmental beef cattle and treated degrees of freedom and scale parameters as unknown with inappropriate priors. Furthermore, we compared the modified methods (BayesFA, BayesFB and BayesFCπ) with their corresponding counterparts using simulation datasets. We found that the modified methods with distribution assumed to the two hyperparameters were beneficial for improving the predictive accuracy. Our results showed that the predictive accuracies of the modified methods were slightly higher than those of their counterparts especially for traits with low heritability and a small number of QTLs. Moreover, cross-validation analysis for three traits, namely carcass weight, live weight and tenderloin weight, in 1136 Simmental beef cattle suggested that predictive accuracy of BayesFCπ noticeably outperformed BayesCπ with the highest increase (3.8\%) for live weight using the cohort masking cross-validation.},

	abstract = {Background: Dense SNP genotypes are often combined with complex trait phenotypes to map causal variants, study genetic architecture and provide genomic predictions for individuals with genotypes but no phenotype. A single method of analysis that jointly fits all genotypes in a Bayesian mixture model (BayesR) has been shown to competitively address all 3 purposes simultaneously. However, BayesR and other similar methods ignore prior biological knowledge and assume all genotypes are equally likely to affect the trait. While this assumption is reasonable for SNP array genotypes, it is less sensible if genotypes are whole-genome sequence variants which should include causal variants.
Results: We introduce a new method (BayesRC) based on BayesR that incorporates prior biological information in the analysis by defining classes of variants likely to be enriched for causal mutations. The information can be derived from a range of sources, including variant annotation, candidate gene lists and known causal variants. This information is then incorporated objectively in the analysis based on evidence of enrichment in the data. We demonstrate the increased power of BayesRC compared to BayesR using real dairy cattle genotypes with simulated phenotypes. The genotypes were imputed whole-genome sequence variants in coding regions combined with dense SNP markers. BayesRC increased the power to detect causal variants and increased the accuracy of genomic prediction. The relative improvement for genomic prediction was most apparent in validation populations that were not closely related to the reference population. We also applied BayesRC to real milk production phenotypes in dairy cattle using independent biological priors from gene expression analyses. Although current biological knowledge of which genes and variants affect milk production is still very incomplete, our results suggest that the new BayesRC method was equal to or more powerful than BayesR for detecting candidate causal variants and for genomic prediction of milk traits.
Conclusions: BayesRC provides a novel and flexible approach to simultaneously improving the accuracy of QTL discovery and genomic prediction by taking advantage of prior biological knowledge. Approaches such as BayesRC will become increasing useful as biological knowledge accumulates regarding functional regions of the genome for a range of traits and species.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques will make dense marker maps available and genotyping many individuals for these markers feasible. Here we attempted to estimate the effects of ف50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 cM was simulated with a marker spacing of 1 cM. The markers surrounding every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to ﬁnite population size (Ne ϭ 100), the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. It was concluded that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation interval.},

However, the performance of DL for genomic prediction of complex human traits has not been comprehensively tested. To provide an evaluation of MLPs and CNNs, we used data from distantly related white Caucasian individuals (n 100k individuals, m 500k SNPs, and k = 1000) of the interim release of the UK Biobank. We analyzed a total of ﬁve phenotypes: height, bone heel mineral density, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and waist–hip ratio, with genomic heritabilities ranging from 0.20 to 0.70. After hyperparameter optimization using a genetic algorithm, we considered several conﬁgurations, from shallow to deep learners, and compared the predictive performance of MLPs and CNNs with that of Bayesian linear regressions across sets of SNPs (from 10k to 50k) that were preselected using single-marker regression analyses. For height, a highly heritable phenotype, all methods performed similarly, although CNNs were slightly but consistently worse. For the rest of the phenotypes, the performance of some CNNs was comparable or slightly better than linear methods. Performance of MLPs was highly dependent on SNP set and phenotype. In all, over the range of traits evaluated in this study, CNN performance was competitive to linear models, but we did not ﬁnd any case where DL outperformed the linear model by a sizable margin. We suggest that more research is needed to adapt CNN methodology, originally motivated by image analysis, to genetic-based problems in order for CNNs to be competitive with linear models.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12864-016-3082-7},
	abstract = {Background: Bayesian mixture models in which the effects of SNP are assumed to come from normal distributions with different variances are attractive for simultaneous genomic prediction and QTL mapping. These models are usually implemented with Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling, which requires long compute times with large genomic data sets. Here, we present an efficient approach (termed HyB\_BR), which is a hybrid of an Expectation-Maximisation algorithm, followed by a limited number of MCMC without the requirement for burn-in.
Results: To test prediction accuracy from HyB\_BR, dairy cattle and human disease trait data were used. In the dairy cattle data, there were four quantitative traits (milk volume, protein kg, fat\% in milk and fertility) measured in 16,214 cattle from two breeds genotyped for 632,002 SNPs. Validation of genomic predictions was in a subset of cattle either from the reference set or in animals from a third breeds that were not in the reference set. In all cases, HyB\_BR gave almost identical accuracies to Bayesian mixture models implemented with full MCMC, however computational time was reduced by up to 1/17 of that required by full MCMC. The SNPs with high posterior probability of a non-zero effect were also very similar between full MCMC and HyB\_BR, with several known genes affecting milk production in this category, as well as some novel genes. HyB\_BR was also applied to seven human diseases with 4890 individuals genotyped for around 300 K SNPs in a case/control design, from the Welcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC). In this data set, the results demonstrated again that HyB\_BR performed as well as Bayesian mixture models with full MCMC for genomic predictions and genetic architecture inference while reducing the computational time from 45 h with full MCMC to 3 h with HyB\_BR.
Conclusions: The results for quantitative traits in cattle and disease in humans demonstrate that HyB\_BR can perform equally well as Bayesian mixture models implemented with full MCMC in terms of prediction accuracy, but with up to 17 times faster than the full MCMC implementations. The HyB\_BR algorithm makes simultaneous genomic prediction, QTL mapping and inference of genetic architecture feasible in large genomic data sets.},

	abstract = {Background: Since both the number of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) used in genomic prediction and the number of individuals used in training datasets are rapidly increasing, there is an increasing need to improve the efficiency of genomic prediction models in terms of computing time and memory (RAM) required.
Methods: In this paper, two alternative algorithms for genomic prediction are presented that replace the originally suggested residual updating algorithm, without affecting the estimates. The first alternative algorithm continues to use residual updating, but takes advantage of the characteristic that the predictor variables in the model (i.e. the SNP genotypes) take only three different values, and is therefore termed “improved residual updating”. The second alternative algorithm, here termed “right-hand-side updating” (RHS-updating), extends the idea of improved residual updating across multiple SNPs. The alternative algorithms can be implemented for a range of different genomic predictions models, including random regression BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction) and most Bayesian genomic prediction models. To test the required computing time and RAM, both alternative algorithms were implemented in a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection model.
Results: Compared to the original algorithm, the improved residual updating algorithm reduced CPU time by 35.3 to 43.3\%, without changing memory requirements. The RHS-updating algorithm reduced CPU time by 74.5 to 93.0\% and memory requirements by 13.1 to 66.4\% compared to the original algorithm.
Conclusions: The presented RHS-updating algorithm provides an interesting alternative to reduce both computing time and memory requirements for a range of genomic prediction models.},

	abstract = {Background:  In whole-genome analyses, the number p of marker covariates is often much larger than the number n of observations. Bayesian multiple regression models are widely used in genomic selection to address this problem of p ≫ n. The primary difference between these models is the prior assumed for the effects of the covariates. Usually in the BayesB method, a Metropolis–Hastings (MH) algorithm is used to jointly sample the marker effect and the locus-specific variance, which may make BayesB computationally intensive. In this paper, we show how the Gibbs sampler without the MH algorithm can be used for the BayesB method.
Results:  We consider three different versions of the Gibbs sampler to sample the marker effect and locus-specific variance for each locus. Among the Gibbs samplers that were considered, the most efficient sampler is about 2.1 times as efficient as the MH algorithm proposed by Meuwissen et al. and 1.7 times as efficient as that proposed by Habier et al.
Conclusions:  The three Gibbs samplers presented here were twice as efficient as Metropolis–Hastings samplers and gave virtually the same results.},

For the former step, BayesB type of estimators have been proposed, which assume a priori that many markers have no effects, and some have an effect coming from a gamma or exponential distribution, i.e. a fat-tailed distribution. Whilst such estimators have been developed using Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC), here we derive a much faster non-MCMC based estimator by analytically performing the required integrations. The accuracy of the genome-wide breeding value estimates was 0.011 (s.e. 0.005) lower than that of the MCMC based BayesB predictor, which may be because the integrations were performed one-byone instead of for all SNPs simultaneously. The bias of the new method was opposite to that of the MCMC based BayesB, in that the new method underestimates the breeding values of the best selection candidates, whereas MCMC-BayesB overestimated their breeding values. The new method was computationally several orders of magnitude faster than MCMC based BayesB, which will mainly be advantageous in computer simulations of entire breeding schemes, in cross-validation testing, and practical schemes with frequent re-estimation of breeding values.},

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels used in genomic prediction are increasing in density, but the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation of SNP effects can be quite time consuming or slow to converge when a large number of SNPs are fitted simultaneously in a linear mixed model. Here we present an EM algorithm (termed ‘‘fastBayesA’’) without MCMC. This fastBayesA approach treats the variances of SNP effects as missing data and uses a joint posterior mode of effects compared to the commonly used BayesA which bases predictions on posterior means of effects. In each EM iteration, SNP effects are predicted as a linear combination of best linear unbiased predictions of breeding values from a mixed linear animal model that incorporates a weighted marker-based realized relationship matrix. Method fastBayesA converges after a few iterations to a joint posterior mode of SNP effects under the BayesA model. When applied to simulated quantitative traits with a range of genetic architectures, fastBayesA is shown to predict GEBV as accurately as BayesA but with less computing effort per SNP than BayesA. Method fastBayesA can be used as a computationally efficient substitute for BayesA, especially when an increasing number of markers bring unreasonable computational burden or slow convergence to MCMC approaches.},

In this article we go back to the basics and build a Bayesian multilocus association model for quantitative and binary traits with carefully deﬁned hierarchical parameterization of Student’s t and Laplace priors. In this treatment we consider alternative model structures, using indicator variables and polygenic terms. We make the most of the conjugate analysis, enabled by the hierarchical formulation of the prior densities, by deriving the fully conditional posterior densities of the parameters and using the acquired known distributions in building fast generalized expectation-maximization estimation algorithms.},

Next, after a brief overview on variable selection methods, we review existing supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised integrative analyses within parallel and hierarchical integration studies, respectively. The strength and limitations of the methods are discussed in detail. No existing integration method can dominate the rest. The computation aspects are also investigated. The review concludes with possible limitations and future directions for multi-level omics data integration.},

	abstract = {The ability to predict the agronomic performance of single-crosses with high precision is essential for selecting superior candidates for hybrid breeding. With recent technological advances, thousands of new parent lines, and, consequently, millions of new hybrid combinations are possible in each breeding cycle, yet only a few hundred can be produced and phenotyped in multi-environment yield trials. Well established prediction approaches such as best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) using pedigree data and whole-genome prediction using genomic data are limited in capturing epistasis and interactions occurring within and among downstream biological strata such as transcriptome and metabolome. Because mRNA and small RNA (sRNA) sequences are involved in transcriptional, translational and post-translational processes, we expect them to provide information inﬂuencing several biological strata. However, using sRNA data of parent lines to predict hybrid performance has not yet been addressed. Here, we gathered genomic, transcriptomic (mRNA and sRNA) and metabolomic data of parent lines to evaluate the ability of the data to predict the performance of untested hybrids for important agronomic traits in grain maize. We found a considerable interaction for predictive ability between predictor and trait, with mRNA data being a superior predictor for grain yield and genomic data for grain dry matter content, while sRNA performed relatively poorly for both traits. Combining mRNA and genomic data as predictors resulted in high predictive abilities across both traits and combining other predictors improved prediction over that of the individual predictors alone. We conclude that downstream “omics” can complement genomics for hybrid prediction, and, thereby, contribute to more efﬁcient selection of hybrid candidates.},

These variances relate directly to ridge regression penalty k and heritability index h2, often used in genetics. Several estimators of these, either based on cross-validation (CV) or maximum marginal likelihood (MML), are also discussed. The comparisons include several cases of the high-dimensional covariate matrix such as multi-collinear covariates and data-derived ones. Moreover, we study robustness against model misspecifications such as sparse instead of dense effects and non-Gaussian errors. An example on weight gain data with genomic covariates confirms the good performance of MML compared to CV. Several extensions are presented. First, to the highdimensional linear mixed effects model, with REML as an alternative to MML. Second, to the conjugate Bayesian setting, shown to be a good alternative. Third, and most prominently, to generalized linear models for which we derive a computationally efficient MML estimator by rewriting the marginal likelihood as an n-dimensional integral. For Poisson and Binomial ridge regression, we demonstrate the superior accuracy of the resulting MML estimator of k as compared to CV. Software is provided to enable reproduction of all results.},

We discuss “formal” empirical Bayes methods that maximize the marginal likelihood but also more informal approaches based on other data summaries. We contrast empirical Bayes to cross-validation and full Bayes and discuss hybrid approaches. To study the relation between the quality of an empirical Bayes estimator and p, the number of variables, we consider a simple empirical Bayes estimator in a linear model setting. We argue that empirical Bayes is particularly useful when the prior contains multiple parameters, which model a priori information on variables termed “co-data”. In particular, we present two novel examples that allow for co-data: first, a Bayesian spike-and-slab setting that facilitates inclusion of multiple co-data sources and types and, second, a hybrid empirical Bayes–full Bayes ridge regression approach for estimation of the posterior predictive interval.},

The methods were compared in terms of inference of the number of QTL and accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs), using simulated scenarios and real data from North American Holstein bulls.
Results: Estimates of π from BayesCπ, in contrast to BayesDπ, were sensitive to the number of simulated QTL and training data size, and provide information about genetic architecture. Milk yield and fat yield have QTL with larger effects than protein yield and somatic cell score. The drawback of BayesA and BayesB did not impair the accuracy of GEBVs. Accuracies of alternative Bayesian methods were similar. BayesA was a good choice for GEBV with the real data. Computing time was shorter for BayesCπ than for BayesDπ, and longest for our implementation of BayesA.
Conclusions: Collectively, accounting for computing effort, uncertainty as to the number of QTL (which affects the GEBV accuracy of alternative methods), and fundamental interest in the number of QTL underlying quantitative traits, we believe that BayesCπ has merit for routine applications.},

	abstract = {Background: Accurate evaluation of SNP effects is important for genome wide association studies and for genomic prediction. The genetic architecture of quantitative traits differs widely, with some traits exhibiting few if any quantitative trait loci (QTL) with large effects, while other traits have one or several easily detectable QTL with large effects.
Methods: Body weight in broilers and egg weight in layers are two examples of traits that have QTL of large effect. A commonly used method for genome wide association studies is to fit a mixture model such as BayesB that assumes some known proportion of SNP effects are zero. In contrast, the most commonly used method for genomic prediction is known as GBLUP, which involves fitting an animal model to phenotypic data with the variance-covariance or genomic relationship matrix among the animals being determined by genome wide SNP genotypes. Genotypes at each SNP are typically weighted equally in determining the genomic relationship matrix for GBLUP. We used the equivalent marker effects model formulation of GBLUP for this study. We compare these two classes of models using egg weight data collected over 8 generations from 2,324 animals genotyped with a 42 K SNP panel.
Results: Using data from the first 7 generations, both BayesB and GBLUP found the largest QTL in a similar well-recognized QTL region, but this QTL was estimated to account for 24 \% of genetic variation with BayesB and less than 1 \% with GBLUP. When predicting phenotypes in generation 8 BayesB accounted for 36 \% of the phenotypic variation and GBLUP for 25 \%. When using only data from any one generation, the same QTL was identified with BayesB in all but one generation but never with GBLUP. Predictions of phenotypes in generations 2 to 7 based on only 295 animals from generation 1 accounted for 10 \% phenotypic variation with BayesB but only 6 \% with GBLUP. Predicting phenotype using only the marker effects in the 1 Mb region that accounted for the largest effect on egg weight from generation 1 data alone accounted for almost 8 \% variation using BayesB but had no predictive power with GBLUP.
Conclusions: In conclusion, In the presence of large effect QTL, BayesB did a better job of QTL detection and its genomic predictions were more accurate and persistent than those from GBLUP.},

This study investigated effects of integrating SNPs selected from imputed WGS data into the data of 54K chip on genomic prediction in Danish Jersey. The WGS SNPs, mainly including peaks of quantitative trait loci, structure variants, regulatory regions of genes, and SNPs within genes with strong effects predicted with variant effect predictor, were selected in previous analyses for dairy breeds in Denmark–Finland–Sweden (DFS) and France (FRA). Animals genotyped with 54K chip, standard LD chip, and customized LD chip which covered selected WGS SNPs and SNPs in the standard LD chip, were imputed to 54K together with DFS and FRA SNPs. Genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) and Bayesian four-distribution mixture models considering 54K and selected WGS SNPs as one (a one-component model) or two separate genetic components (a two-component model) were used to predict breeding values. For milk production traits and mastitis, both DFS (0.025) and FRA (0.029) sets of additional WGS SNPs improved reliabilities, and inclusions of all selected WGS SNPs generally achieved highest improvements of reliabilities (0.034). A Bayesian four-distribution model yielded higher reliabilities than a GBLUP model for milk and protein, but extra gains in reliabilities from using selected WGS SNPs were smaller for a Bayesian fourdistribution model than a GBLUP model. Generally, no signiﬁcant difference was observed between one-component and two-component models, except for using GBLUP models for milk.},

Here, we investigated whether complete or partial sequence data can improve upon existing SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) array-based selection strategies by simulation using a mixed coalescence - gene-dropping approach.
Results: We simulated 20 or 100 causal mutations (quantitative trait nucleotides, QTN) within 65 predefined ‘gene’ regions, each 10 kb long, within a genome composed of ten 3-Mb chromosomes. We compared prediction accuracy by cross-validation using a medium-density chip (7.5 k SNPs), a high-density (HD, 17 k) and sequence data (335 k). Genetic evaluation was based on a GBLUP method. The simulations showed: (1) a law of diminishing returns with increasing number of SNPs; (2) a modest effect of SNP ascertainment bias in arrays; (3) a small advantage of using whole-genome sequence data vs. HD arrays i.e. {\textasciitilde}4\%; (4) a minor effect of NGS errors except when imputation error rates are high (≥20\%); and (5) if QTN were known, prediction accuracy approached 1. Since this is obviously unrealistic, we explored milder assumptions. We showed that, if all SNPs within causal genes were included in the prediction model, accuracy could also dramatically increase by {\textasciitilde}40\%. However, this criterion was highly sensitive to either misspecification (including wrong genes) or to the use of an incomplete gene list; in these cases, accuracy fell rapidly towards that reached when all SNPs from sequence data were blindly included in the model.
Conclusions: Our study shows that, unless an accurate prior estimate on the functionality of SNPs can be included in the predictor, there is a law of diminishing returns with increasing SNP density. As a result, use of whole-genome sequence data may not result in a highly increased selection response over high-density genotyping.},

Our research spans both ﬁelds and so we recognize factors that are very obvious for those in one ﬁeld, but less so for those in the other. Differences in family size between species is the wedge that drives the different viewpoints and approaches. Large family size achievable in nonhuman species accompanied by selection generates a smaller effective population size, increased linkage disequilibrium and a higher average genetic relationship between individuals within a population. In human genetic analyses, we select individuals unrelated in the classical sense (coefﬁcient of relationship ,0.05) to estimate heritability captured by common SNPs. In livestock data, all animals within a breed are to some extent “related,” and so it is not possible to select unrelated individuals and retain a data set of sufﬁcient size to analyze. These differences directly or indirectly impact the way data analyses are undertaken. In livestock, genetic segregation variance exposed through samplings of parental genomes within families is directly observable and taken for granted. In humans, this genomic variation is under-recognized for its contribution to variation in polygenic risk of common disease, in both those with and without family history of disease. We explore the equation that predicts the expected proportion of variance explained using PRS, and quantify how GWAS sample size is the key factor for maximizing accuracy of prediction in both humans and livestock. Last, we bring together the concepts discussed to address some frequently asked questions.},

	abstract = {Background:  Transforming large amounts of genomic data into valuable knowledge for predicting complex traits has been an important challenge for animal and plant breeders. Prediction of complex traits has not escaped the current excitement on machine-learning, including interest in deep learning algorithms such as multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The aim of this study was to compare the predictive performance of two deep learning methods (MLP and CNN), two ensemble learning methods [random forests (RF) and gradient boosting (GB)], and two parametric methods [genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) and Bayes B] using real and simulated datasets.
Methods:  The real dataset consisted of 11,790 Holstein bulls with sire conception rate (SCR) records and genotyped for 58k single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To support the evaluation of deep learning methods, various simula‑tion studies were conducted using the observed genotype data as template, assuming a heritability of 0.30 with either additive or non-additive gene effects, and two different numbers of quantitative trait nucleotides (100 and 1000).
Results:  In the bull dataset, the best predictive correlation was obtained with GB (0.36), followed by Bayes B (0.34), GBLUP (0.33), RF (0.32), CNN (0.29) and MLP (0.26). The same trend was observed when using mean squared error of prediction. The simulation indicated that when gene action was purely additive, parametric methods outperformed other methods. When the gene action was a combination of additive, dominance and of two-locus epistasis, the best predictive ability was obtained with gradient boosting, and the superiority of deep learning over the parametric methods depended on the number of loci controlling the trait and on sample size. In fact, with a large dataset includ‑ing 80k individuals, the predictive performance of deep learning methods was similar or slightly better than that of parametric methods for traits with non-additive gene action.
Conclusions:  For prediction of traits with non-additive gene action, gradient boosting was a robust method. Deep learning approaches were not better for genomic prediction unless non-additive variance was sizable.},

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.04.16.044685},
	abstract = {Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in large human cohorts have identified thousands of loci associated with complex traits and diseases. For identifying the genes and gene-associated variants that underlie complex traits in livestock, especially where sample sizes are limiting, it may help to integrate the results of GWAS for equivalent traits in humans as prior information. In this study, we sought to investigate the usefulness of results from a GWAS on human height as prior information for identifying the genes and gene-associated variants that affect stature in cattle, using GWAS summary data on samples sizes of 700,000 and 58,265 for humans and cattle, respectively. Using Fisher's exact test, we observed a significant proportion of cattle stature-associated genes (30/77) that are also associated with human height (odds ratio = 5.1, p = 3.1e-10). Result of randomized sampling tests showed that cattle orthologs of human height-associated genes, hereafter referred to as candidate genes (C-genes), were more enriched for cattle stature GWAS signals than random samples of genes in the cattle genome (p=0.01). Randomly sampled SNPs within the C-genes also tend to explain more genetic variance for cattle stature (up to 13.2\%) than randomly sampled SNPs within random cattle genes (p=0.09). The most significant SNPs from a cattle GWAS for stature within the C-genes did not explain more genetic variance for cattle stature than the most significant SNPs within random cattle genes (p=0.87). Altogether, our findings support previous studies that suggest a similarity in the genetic regulation of height across mammalian species. However, with the availability of a powerful GWAS for stature that combined data from 8 cattle breeds, prior information from human-height GWAS does not seem to provide any additional benefit with respect to the identification of genes and gene-associated variants that affect stature in cattle.},

	title = {A multi-trait {Bayesian} method for mapping {QTL} and genomic prediction},
	abstract = {Background:  Genomic prediction and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping typically analyze one trait at a time but this may ignore the possibility that one polymorphism affects multiple traits. The aim of this study was to develop a multivariate Bayesian approach that could be used for simultaneously elucidating genetic architecture, QTL mapping, and genomic prediction. Our approach uses information from multiple traits to divide markers into ‘unassociated’ (no association with any trait) and ‘associated’ (associated with one or more traits). The effect of associated markers is estimated independently for each trait to avoid the assumption that QTL effects follow a multi-variate normal distribution.
Results:  Using simulated data, our multivariate method (BayesMV) detected a larger number of true QTL (with a posterior probability {\textgreater} 0.9) and increased the accuracy of genomic prediction compared to an equivalent univariate method (BayesR). With real data, accuracies of genomic prediction in validation sets for milk yield traits with high-density genotypes were approximately equal to those from equivalent single-trait methods. BayesMV tended to select a similar number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per trait for genomic prediction compared to BayesR (i.e. those with non-zero effects), but BayesR selected different sets of SNPs for each trait, whereas BayesMV selected a common set of SNPs across traits. Despite these two dramatically different estimates of genetic architecture (i.e. different SNPs affecting each trait vs. pleiotropic SNPs), both models indicated that 3000 to 4000 SNPs are associated with a trait. The BayesMV approach may be advantageous when the aim is to develop a low-density SNP chip that works well for a number of traits. SNPs for milk yield traits identified by BayesMV and BayesR were also found to be associated with detailed milk composition.
Conclusions:  The BayesMV method simultaneously estimates the proportion of SNPs that are associated with a combination of traits. When applied to milk production traits, most of the identified SNPs were associated with all three traits (milk, fat and protein yield). BayesMV aims at exploiting pleiotropic QTL and selects a small number of SNPs that could be used to predict multiple traits.},

	abstract = {Background: The accuracy of genomic prediction is highly dependent on the size of the reference population. For small populations, including information from other populations could improve this accuracy. The usual strategy is to pool data from different populations; however, this has not proven as successful as hoped for with distantly related breeds. BayesRS is a novel approach to share information across populations for genomic predictions. The approach allows information to be captured even where the phase of SNP alleles and casuative mutation alleles are reversed across populations, or the actual casuative mutation is different between the populations but affects the same gene. Proportions of a four-distribution mixture for SNP effects in segments of fixed size along the genome are derived from one population and set as location specific prior proportions of distributions of SNP effects for the target population. The model was tested using dairy cattle populations of different breeds: 540 Australian Jersey bulls, 2297 Australian Holstein bulls and 5214 Nordic Holstein bulls. The traits studied were protein-, fat- and milk yield. Genotypic data was Illumina 777K SNPs, real or imputed.
Results: Results showed an increase in accuracy of up to 3.5\% for the Jersey population when using BayesRS with a prior derived from Australian Holstein compared to a model without location specific priors. The increase in accuracy was however lower than was achieved when reference populations were combined to estimate SNP effects, except in the case of fat yield. The small size of the Jersey validation set meant that these improvements in accuracy were not significant using a Hotelling-Williams t-test at the 5\% level. An increase in accuracy of 1-2\% for all traits was observed in the Australian Holstein population when using a prior derived from the Nordic Holstein population compared to using no prior information. These improvements were significant (P{\textless}0.05) using the Hotelling Williams t-test for protein- and fat yield.
Conclusion: For some traits the method might be advantageous compared to pooling of reference data for distantly related populations, but further investigation is needed to confirm the results. For closely related populations the method does not perform better than pooling reference data. However, it does give an increased accuracy compared to analysis based on only one reference population, without an increased computational burden. The approach described here provides a general setup for inclusion of location specific priors: the approach could be used to include biological information in genomic predictions.},

Custom genotyping chips, which combine medium-density genotypes with a custom genotype panel, can capitalize on these candidates to potentially yield improved accuracy and interpretability in genomic prediction. A particularly promising model to this end is BayesR, which divides markers into four effect size classes. BayesR has been shown to yield accurate predictions and promise for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in real data applications, but an extensive benchmarking in simulated data is currently lacking. Based on a set of real genotypes, we generated simulated data under a variety of genetic architectures, phenotype heritabilities, and we evaluated the impact of excluding or including causal markers among the genotypes. We define several statistical criteria for QTL mapping, including several based on sliding windows to account for linkage disequilibrium. We compare and contrast these statistics and their ability to accurately prioritize known causal markers. Overall, we confirm the strong predictive performance for BayesR in moderately to highly heritable traits, particularly for 50k custom data. In cases of low heritability or weak linkage disequilibrium with the causal marker in 50k genotypes, QTL mapping is a challenge, regardless of the criterion used. BayesR is a promising approach to simultaneously obtain accurate predictions and interpretable classifications of SNPs into effect size classes. We illustrated the performance of BayesR in a variety of simulation scenarios, and compared the advantages and limitations of each.},

	abstract = {To increase statistical power to identify genes associated with complex traits, a number of transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods have been proposed using gene expression as a mediating trait linking genetic variations and diseases. These methods first predict expression levels based on inferred expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and then identify expression-mediated genetic effects on diseases by associating phenotypes with predicted expression levels. The success of these methods critically depends on the identification of eQTLs, which may not be functional in the corresponding tissue, due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the correlation of gene expression between tissues. Here, we introduce a new method called T-GEN (

Through prioritizing SNPs with tissue-specific epigenetic annotation, T-GEN can better identify SNPs that are both statistically predictive and biologically functional. We found that a significantly higher percentage (an increase of 18.7\% to 47.2\%) of eQTLs identified by T-GEN are inferred to be functional by ChromHMM and more are deleterious based on their Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) scores. Applying T-GEN to 207 complex traits, we were able to identify more trait-associated genes (ranging from 7.7\% to 102\%) than those from existing methods. Among the identified genes associated with these traits, T-GEN can better identify genes with high ({\textgreater}0.99) pLI scores compared to other methods. When T-GEN was applied to late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, we identified 96 genes located at 15 loci, including two novel loci not implicated in previous GWAS. We further replicated 50 genes in an independent GWAS, including one of the two novel loci.},

The estimated ROC curve depends on the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR), with the key metric being the area under the curve (AUC). With small samples these rates need to be estimated from the training data, so a natural question arises: How well do the estimates of the AUC, TPR and FPR compare with the true metrics? Results: Through a simulation study using data models and analysis of real microarray data, we show that (i) for small samples the root mean square differences of the estimated and true metrics are considerable; (ii) even for large samples, there is only weak correlation between the true and estimated metrics; and (iii) generally, there is weak regression of the true metric on the estimated metric. For classiﬁcation rules, we consider linear discriminant analysis, linear support vector machine (SVM) and radial basis function SVM. For error estimation, we consider resubstitution, three kinds of crossvalidation and bootstrap. Using resampling, we show the unreliability of some published ROC results.},

We analyse data for 155 complex traits (n = 27k–547k) and project the estimates onto those obtained from evolutionary simulations. We estimate that, on average across traits, about 1\% of human genome sequence are mutational targets with a mean selection coefficient of {\textasciitilde}0.001. Common diseases, on average, show a smaller number of mutational targets and have been under stronger selection, compared to other traits. SBayesS analyses incorporating functional annotations reveal that selection signatures vary across genomic regions, among which coding regions have the strongest selection signature and are enriched for both the number of associated variants and the magnitude of effect sizes.},

We show in extensive simulation work the benefits BayesW provides in terms of number of discoveries, model performance and genomic prediction. In the UK Biobank, we find many thousands of common genomic regions underlying the age-at-onset of high blood pressure (HBP), cardiac disease (CAD), and type-2 diabetes (T2D), and for the genetic basis of onset reflecting the underlying genetic liability to disease. Age-at-menopause and age-at-menarche are also highly polygenic, but with higher variance contributed by low frequency variants. Genomic prediction into the Estonian Biobank data shows that BayesW gives higher prediction accuracy than other approaches.},

We develop a Bayesian model (BayesRR-RC) implemented in a hybrid-parallel algorithm that scales to whole-genome sequence data on many hundreds of thousands of individuals, taking 22 seconds per iteration to estimate the inclusion probabilities and effect sizes of 8.4 million markers and 78 SNP-heritability parameters in the UK Biobank. We show in theory and simulation that BayesRR-RC provides robust variance component and enrichment estimates, improved marker discovery and effect estimates over mixed-linear model association approaches, and accurate genomic prediction. Of the genetic variation captured for height, body mass index, cardiovascular disease, and type-2 diabetes in the UK Biobank, only ≤ 10\% is attributable to proximal regulatory regions within 10kb upstream of genes, while 12-25\% is attributed to coding regions, 32-44\% to intronic regions, and 22-28\% to distal 10-500kb upstream regions. ≥ 60\% of the variance contributed by these exonic, intronic and distal 10-500kb regions is underlain by many thousands of common variants, which on average have larger effect sizes than for other annotation groups. Up to 24\% of all cis and coding regions of each chromosome are associated with each trait, with over 3,100 independent exonic and intronic regions and over 5,400 independent regulatory regions having ≥ 95\% probability of contributing ≥ 0.001\% to the genetic variance of these four traits. Thus, these quantitative and disease traits are truly complex. The BayesRR-RC prior gives robust model performance across the data analysed, providing an alternative to current approaches.},

	abstract = {Gene expression proﬁles potentially hold valuable information for the prediction of breeding values and phenotypes. In this study, the utility of transcriptome data for phenotype prediction was tested with 185 inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster for nine traits in two sexes. We incorporated the transcriptome data into genomic prediction via two methods: GTBLUP and GRBLUP, both combining single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and transcriptome data. The genotypic data was used to construct the common additive genomic relationship, which was used in genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) or jointly in a linear mixed model with a transcriptome-based linear kernel (GTBLUP), or with a transcriptome-based Gaussian kernel (GRBLUP). We studied the predictive ability of the models and discuss a concept of “omics-augmented broad sense heritability” for the multi-omics era. For most traits, GRBLUP and GBLUP provided similar predictive abilities, but GRBLUP explained more of the phenotypic variance. There was only one trait (olfactory perception to Ethyl Butyrate in females) in which the predictive ability of GRBLUP (0.23) was signiﬁcantly higher than the predictive ability of GBLUP (0.21). Our results suggest that accounting for transcriptome data has the potential to improve genomic predictions if transcriptome data can be included on a larger scale.},
